## Problem Statment

The number of traffic accidents and the casuialties resulted from these accidents are enourmos in saudi arabia. applying new rules and regulations and puting strict penalties on the traffic violations has decreased the number of accidents between 2016 and 2017. however, the number of traffic accidents in the kingdom still very high. data for the traffic accidents for each administrative area in the kingdom was gathered for 2016 and 2017. also, data of the number of driving licenses issued were gathered for each province for many years. we hope that by analysing this data we can extract insights and help reducing the number of traffic accidents in the kingdom.

The number of traffic Accidents in any place is goverened by three root drivers:
1. The number of cars on the road.
2. The Driver behaviour. 
3. Road structure and traffic engineering.

Any increase or decrease in the number accidents will be drived by one or more of these drivers. for example, imposing traffic violations tickets aims to regulate the driver behaviour and so on.

## Executive Summary

- It is highly recommended to take other approaches to solve the problem of traffic accidents. for example, In addition to the traffic rules that is used to regulate the driver behaviour, we might try reducing the number of cars on the roads by providing public transportation options i.e. buses and subways.

- This project aims to fined trends and insights that will help us understand the accidents and help minimizing it.
For the years from 1993 to 2017 we have the data of the number of driving licenses issued for each administrative area. On the other dataset, we have data of the accidents, the dead and injured casualities from these accidents for 2016 and 2017 for each administrative area.

- It was found that there is a strong positive correlation between the number of driving licenses and the number of traffic accidents. This means that as the number of driving licenses increase there is statically high relation that the number of accidents will also increase. As the the number of accidents increase there is also statically strong relation that the number of dead and injured people will increase and this is really an intuitive conclusion.

- The three regions that have the highest mean driving licenses are Makkah, Riyadh and Eastern Province respectivaly. 
The three regions that have the highest mean traffic accidents are Makkah, Riyadh and Eastern Province respectivaly.
we see that the same patteren emerges for both the number of driving licenses and the number of traffic accidents which further prove the high correlation between the two features.

- The analysis shows that the number of traffic accidents in the kingdom is decreasing with time mainly due to the regulations and new violations system.

- It is highly recommended to take other approaches to solve the problem of traffic accidents. for example, In addition to the traffic rules that is used to regulate the driver behaviour, we might try reducing the number of cars on the roads by providing public transportation options i.e. buses and subways.

- It is obvious that the traffic accidents in Saudi Arabia are decreasing with time (notice the decrease in the accidents mean between 2016 to 2018). This decrease is highly because of the high decrease in the three main regions (Riyadh, Makkah and Eastern). Despite the fact that Driving Licenses issued generally is increaseing, the number of accidents decreased. 

## Conclusions and Recommendations
- In KSA, the number of accidents is decreasing over time. the mean number of accidents has decreased by 51.32% from 2016 to 2018, which is a huge difference. This decrease is the result of the strict implementation of traffic laws and regulations including increasing the traffic violation tickets and Saher system. All these efforts are made to regulate the driver behaviour. In my opinion, the lack of data about the traffic accidents in the kingdom minmize the ability to exctract trends or more insights from the data.
